  <h3>Solution Overview</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="content-col">
      <h5>When you hit the power button, what happens?</h5>
      <p>• If your computer does not start, begin by checking the power cord to confirm that it is plugged securely into the back of the computer case and the power outlet.</p>
      <p>• If it is plugged into an outlet, make sure it is a working outlet. To check your outlet, you can plug in another electrical device, such as a lamp.</p>
      <p>• If the computer is plugged in to a surge protector, verify that it is turned on. You may have to reset the surge protector by turning it off and then back on. You can also plug a lamp or other device into the surge protector to verify that it's working correctly.</p>
      <p>• If you are using a laptop, the battery may not be charged. Plug the AC adapter into the wall, then try to turn on the laptop. If it still doesn't start up, you may need to wait a few minutes and try again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-col">
      <h5>An application is running slowly</h5>
      <p>• Close and reopen the application.</p>
      <p>• Maybe an update to Windows or some other program is to blame. Update the application, to do this, click the Help menu and look for an option to check for Updates. If you don't find this option, another idea is to run an online search for application updates.</p>
      <p>• Try to install some anti-virus.</p>
      <p>• Remove Unnecessary Software & Applications.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-col">
      <h5>The mouse or keyboard has stopped working</h5>
      <p>• If you're using a wired mouse or keyboard, make sure it's correctly plugged into the computer.</p>
      <p>• If you're using a wireless mouse or keyboard, make sure it's turned on and that its batteries are charged.</p>
